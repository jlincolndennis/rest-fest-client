# RESTFest\*
## All The Best Fests!

A posting board for musical festivals built with Angular 1

### Featuring:
  * Bootstrap
  * Angular Moment for date formatting
  * ngMessages for error messages


## Build & development

Fork and clone, if ya want, then run `npm install`.

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.



\* Its funny because there's not actually an API (yet), RESTful, or otherwise.
